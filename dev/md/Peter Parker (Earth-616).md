>"Hope you were watching, Uncle Ben. 'Cause I did that for you. Kept everyone safe. Kept them from being scared. And I made it fun. It doesn't matter that most of 'em wouldn't have lifted a finger for Peter Parker. That's not why you do it. You do it 'cause it's the right thing to do. Because it's what you would've done. You were more than a father to me, Ben Parker. More than a role model... You were my hero. Now it's my turn. Because from now on, I'm going to be yours! You'll see. I'm going to give it my all! We'll have fun! I'll never quit-- --and it's going to be Amazing! Quote2

## Early life

Peter Benjamin Parker was born in Queens to Richard and Mary Parker.[48] While Peter was still an infant, his parents were assigned by the CIA to infiltrate the Algerian based spy ring controlled by the communist agent, the Red Skull. The moment the Red Skull learned that Richard and Mary were double agents, he had them killed by one of his agents, the Finisher, in an airplane crash overseas and then framed them for treason.[49] Before their deaths however, Richard and Mary had another child unknown to all others including Peter himself, a daughter and Peter's younger sister, Teresa.

An orphaned Peter went to live with his uncle and aunt, Ben and May Parker, in Forest Hills, New York; they became Peterâ€™s surrogate parents and raised him as if he were their own son. Over the next nine years, Parker grew to be extremely bright in science and became a high honors student at Midtown High School. Parker's shyness and scholastic interest often made him a social outcast and a target for bullies, primarily football star Eugene "Flash" Thompson.

## Becoming Spider-Man

While attending a public exhibition demonstrating the safe handling of nuclear laboratory waste materials, sponsored by the General Techtronics Corporation, the 15-year-old Peter Parker was bitten on the hand by a spider that had been irradiated by a particle accelerator used in the demonstration. Unbeknownst to him, after the spider fell from his hand, it bit a girl, Cindy Moon on the ankle before it died from the radiation.[50] Making his way home afterwards, Peter was almost hit by a car; when Peter jumped out of the way, Peter discovered he had somehow gained incredible strength, agility, and the ability to cling to walls, spider-like traits that he immediately associated with the spider bite.

Encountering an ad offering a cash prize for staying in the ring for three minutes with professional wrestler Joseph "Crusher" Hogan, Peter decided this would be a good way to test his powers. Wearing a mask to avoid potential embarrassment in case he lost the match, Peter easily defeated his opponent. TV producer Maxwell Shiffman observed his performance and convinced him to go on television with his 'act.' Designing a full costume and fabricating a fluid similar to a spider's web and wrist-mounted web-shooters, Peter called himself Spider-Man, becoming an immediate sensation.

Following his first TV appearance, Peter failed to act to stop an escaping thief, claiming that it was not his responsibility to do so. Peter forgot the incident as his fame rose, but days later he returned home at night to find his Uncle Ben had been murdered. Learning the police had the burglar responsible holed up in a warehouse, Peter changed to Spider-Man and easily captured him only to discover he was the same thief he had allowed to escape earlier. Filled with remorse, he realized that when someone has power, he has an obligation to use it responsibly, so he decided to become a superhero.

## Taking on Great Responsibility

he first problem young Peter faced was the lack of money with the death of his uncle. Due to the fact that his Aunt May was too weak to work and Peter was seen as fragile, he decided to get a job, even though Aunt May wanted him to become a scientist instead. Peter even thought about using his spider powers for crime, but decided against it after thinking how his Aunt would react to him in jail.

However, it was seeming impossible to him to find a job in order to pay his growing debts. As Spider-Man, he was not able to continue his career as TV star, because of J. Jonah Jameson, owner of the NOW Magazine and the newspaper Daily Bugle. Jameson started a campaign against Spidey, stating that he was a bad influence for children and a criminal for taking justice into his own hands, referring to the situation with the burglar. These protests start taking effect and turning the public against Spider-Man, causing Spidey's manager to leave him, impeding his ability to earn money even as Spider-Man.[33]

Peter searched through the wanted ads, only to be rejected by all the employers. Not being able to use his super-powers as Spider-Man infuriated Peter, and his fury only intensified after seeing his Aunt May selling her jewelry to try and earn some money.

Spidey's second heroic action was to save Jameson's astronaut son, John Jameson from an accident in a deviated space capsule. Spider-Man hitched a ride on a small airplane, and boarded the capsule during re-entry. Spidey then attached the missing capsule piece, allowing it to land safely. Although he had saved John, Spidey was still blamed by J.J. Jameson for the accident.

Later, trying to find a way to make some money, he decided to join the superhero team the Fantastic Four. Spidey intruded into the Baxter Building, battling the FF, as a way of showing them his power, but the team refused Spidey's entry after explaining to him that they did not get paid for their actions and that they were a family, not an enterprise. Later that day, the Russian criminal and master of disguise known as the Chameleon used Spider-Man's identity to steal defense missile plans. The real Spidey was used by Chameleon as a pawn to escape the scene without problems. After managing to avoid capture by the police, Spider-Man caught Chameleon in a helicopter before he could reach a soviet submarine and handed him in to the authorities.[33] Peter finally found a way to make money when the Daily Bugle asked for photos of the winged criminal known as the Vulture. Not only did Spider-Man defeat the villain, he also found a way to take photos, which caused J.J. Jameson to hire Peter to get him pictures of Spider-Man, under the condition that the publicist would not ask Peter how he took the pictures.[51]

Early in his career, Spider-Man fought many villains including the Tinkerer,[51] Doctor Octopus,[52] the Sandman,[53] Doctor Doom,[54] the Fox,[55] the Lizard,[56] the Living Brain,[57] Electro,[58] the Big Man and his Enforcers,[59] Mysterio,[60] Kraven the Hunter,[61] and his deadliest foe of all time: the Green Goblin.[62] Several of these villains would form the Sinister Six, under the leadership of Doctor Octopus, a team who tried to get Spider-Man by kidnapping Aunt May and trying to force Peter to "call" him. They failed.[63]

During this time, Parker dated Betty Brant of the Daily Bugle, although Liz Allan had a crush on him. At the same time, both Peter's Aunt May and their neighbor, Anna Watson, were constantly encouraging Parker to date Anna's niece, Mary Jane Watson.

Before his high school graduation Peter continued to fight off menaces, including the Scorpion,[64] Spencer Smythe's Spider-Slayers,[3] the Crime-Master,[65] and the Molten Man.[66] He also assisted the recently formed Avengers in defeating a Spider-Man robot created by Kang.[67]

At one point, Aunt May's health got so bad that she suffered from a heart attack. Peter heard the news while he and the Human Torch were fighting the Green Goblin, and he was forced to flee in order to get to her quickly. However, this only convinced the public at-large that Spidey was a coward who had fled from a battle.[68] Die-hard Spider-Man fans like Flash Thompson continued to support him, while J. Jonah Jameson ran editions in the Bugle claiming that he himself scared Spider-Man off. While looking after Aunt May, Spider-Man was forced to escape yet again from the Sandman in order to get home quickly. When he learned that his aunt's health had improved, he vowed to prove the world wrong about him.[69] Meanwhile, a worried Torch tried to look for Spidey, but only managed to get captured by the Sandman. Spider-Man rescued him and defeated his enemy, wiping the smirk off of Jameson's face and getting the world to appreciate him again.

## A Hero in the University

Eventually, Peter graduated from high school as valedictorian[71] and enrolled at Empire State University on a science scholarship,[66] meeting new classmates such as Harry Osborn and Gwen Stacy.[72] Even though he got off to a bad start with them, finally Peter became friends with them, as well as Flash. The Green Goblin came back and discovered Spider-Man's identity, kidnapping him and revealing his own alter-ego, that of Norman Osborn, Harry's father. In a furious battle, the villain lost all memories of his time as a supervillain.[73]

During that time, Spider-Man fought new foes such as the Rhino,[74] the Shocker,[75] as well as teaming up with Dr. Strange to defeat the wizard known as Xandu.[76] The Avengers also tried to make him a member at one point, but Spider-Man declined the offer.[77] Also, Peter finally met Mary Jane Watson,[78] but at that time he was interested in Gwen, so Mary Jane started dating Harry.

After finding an old newspaper clipping that identifies that his parents were traitors to their country in his auntâ€™s house, Peter decided to learn the full story, traveling to Algeria with the Fantastic Four's aid. He learns that his parents were supposedly spies who worked for the Red Skull and he came across their ID badges for the Skull's organization. Spider-Man also stumbles upon the original Nazi Red Skull and his men, who previously worked for the other Red Skull. In the aftermath, he finds that his father's CIA identification card, proving to Peter that his parents were secret government operatives. With evidence to clear his parents' names, Peter returns to the States.[49]

Weeks later, after the return of Kraven and battling a new Vulture,[79] Peter started wondering if he may be better off not being Spider-Man. Crime rose and a new Kingpin appeared in New York, and abducted J. J. Jameson. Peter returned to his heroic identity, and Frederick Foswell, formerly the criminal Big Man, sacrificed his life to save Jameson's.[80]

A mystical artifact called the Tablet of Life and Time exhibited in ESU was stolen by the Kingpin; the Tablet passed over many people who tried to get it, including Spider-Man, Shocker (who was working for Kingpin) and Man Mountain Marko (who was working for the Maggia crime family). Finally the Tablet got to the Maggia boss, Silvermane, who forced Doctor Curt Connors to translate the tablet. Connors managed to create a powerful rejuvenation serum from it. Silvermane drank it and became a young man again. But the serum made Silvermane regress beyond birth. Meanwhile Connors, as the Lizard, escaped, and later was returned to normal by Spider-Man again.

## The Death of the Stacys

Soon after, Doctor Octopus managed to get his metallic arms again and broke free from prison. After Spider-Man thwarted his attempt to hijack a plane, he started attacking the city's main power plant. Although Spider-Man escaped from Ock, Spider-Man was attacked by surprise by Ock the next day. They battled on a rooftop and Captain Stacy died when saving a child from falling debris. Before dying, Stacy revealed to Spider-Man he knew his identity, and asked him to take care of Gwen.[82]

Being accused for Stacy's death, Spider-Man faced some heroes who wanted to take him to authorities, such as the X-Man Iceman[83] and the beginner hero the Prowler.[84] Peter even went to London to prevent Gwen's departure forever, after her father's death.[85]

Things got worse. Harry became addicted to LSD, and Peter, along with Gwen and Mary Jane, took care of him. This familial stress caused Norman Osborn's Green Goblin persona to return, and he once again battled Spider-Man. During the battle Norman was exposed to his son's declining condition in the hospital. This severed the control of the Green Goblin persona over Norman and caused Norman to have amnesia again.

With his secret identity making his life impossible, Peter tried to give up being Spider-Man and created a cure for his powers that instead made him grow four extra arms.[87] With the help of Curt Connors he found a cure, fighting Morbius the Living Vampire and Connors' alter-ego the Lizard in the process.

Norman Osborn's alter-ego resurfaced again and the Green Goblin kidnapped Gwen Stacy. Spider-Man found them at the George Washington Bridge, where they fought and Gwen fell from the bridge. She died when Spider-Man reached her with a web-line, breaking her neck.[89] The Goblin escaped. A furious Peter searched, found and battled him again. In this battle Norman was impaled with his own Goblin Glider, apparently killing himself. 

Peter was extremely distraught over the death of Gwen, possibly even more so than when Uncle Ben died. An equally traumatized Mary Jane tried to comfort Peter after Gwen's death; she was initially brushed off, but they eventually got closer.[90]

After being accused of the death of both Stacys, and attending Gwen's funeral as Peter, Spider-Man was confronted by heroes such as Power Man[91] and the Punisher.[92] Later, Harry, who had discerned Spider-Man's identity and wanted revenge for his father's death, took the Green Goblin mantle and kidnapped Flash Thompson, Mary Jane and Aunt May in an attempt to lure him out and kill him. Spider-Man managed to find him at his father's old home and defeated him, leaving him to the authorities. Harry was sent to an asylum.

## The Original Clone Saga

Peter later had to go on a work trip with Robbie Robertson, and he and Mary Jane shared their first kiss at the airport. After returning from the trip to France, Peter found an alive Gwen Stacy, but could not bear to rekindle their relationship because of his kiss with MJ. With the help of Ned Leeds, Spider-Man found out that this Gwen was a clone created by the Jackal, who, after defeating Spider-Man with the help of Tarantula, was revealed to be Peter's professor, Miles Warren.

After kidnapping Leeds and Spider-Man, Warren explained to the hero that he loved Gwen and blamed Spider-Man for her death. And after managing to clone a frog, he used a blood sample from Gwen to clone her. Later, Spider-Man was left unconscious in a stadium, where he battled a clone of himself to save Ned from a bomb.

Gwen's clone made Jackal realize everything was wrong, so he freed Ned and the bomb exploded, apparently killing the Jackal and the Spider-Clone. Spider-Man took the corpse of his clone and buried it at an industrial chimney, while the clone of Gwen Stacy left New York.[95] Unsure whether he was the real Peter Parker or the clone, he had Curt Connors run tests on him. However, he never checked the results, being convinced by his emotions for Mary Jane that he must be the original.

## A New Appreciation for Life

Peter had to leave Betty Brant's engagement party to defeat the Shocker, causing friction between him and Mary Jane.[97] Peter served as best man at Ned Leeds's and Betty Brant's wedding.[98] Spider-Man later faced Harry's psychologist, Bart Hamilton, who became the third Green Goblin, and who, after various encounters, died at the hands of Harry.[99] Peter proposed marriage to Mary Jane,[100] but she did not accept, making their relationship falter. MJ moved to Florida with her Aunt Anna.[101]

Spider-Man managed to clear his name, while Peter Parker graduated from ESU.[102] Also, Spencer Smythe, the creator of the Spider-Slayers, died from an illness after trying to kill Spider-Man and Jameson, the men he blamed for ruining his life.

As Peter continued to live on his own, his Aunt May decided to transform her home into a senior citizens' boarding house. At one point, Mysterio managed to convince the wall-crawler that she had died.[104] Spider-Man later discovered that she had been kidnapped by the same burglar who had shot his Uncle Ben. After cornering him furiously and revealing that he was the nephew of Ben Parker, the burglar died of fright.[105]

At one point Parker began a romantic relationship and heroic partnership with the Black Cat,[106] developing feelings for her and even starting to love her, although Parker later broke it off due to the Black Cat's disdain for Parker's life apart from being Spider-Man.
